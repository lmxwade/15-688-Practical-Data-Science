    "In this notebook, you will classify emails as either spam or not spam using support vector machines. You are given a dataset of labeled emails, where the labels are 1 if they are ham (not spam), and -1 if they are spam. The lines of the emails have already been slightly processed, such that different words are space delimited, however little other processing has occurred. \n",

    "## Preliminary notes\n",
    "1. You cannot use scikit-learn. \n",
    "2. As we move into more advanced algorithms and techniques, there will be more introductions of randomness. This means that some of the example outputs in the notebook contain some randomness, and will probably not match your results exactly. Verify your code by checking your properties/invariants or feeding in static inputs for which you can calculate the output. "

    "## SVM classification\n",
    "Recall the support vector machine (SVM) from slide 17 of linear classification. It a straightforward algorithm, but there are some performance- and sparsity-related caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "1. If you do not use matrix operations, your code will be **very slow**. Every function in here can be implemented in 1 or 2 lines using matrix equations, and the only for loop you need is the training loop for gradient descent. **If your code is slow here, it will be extremely slow in the next section when doing parameter search**.\n",
    "2. You should train your SVM using gradient descent as described in the slides. \n",
    "3. Since this is a convex function, your gradient steps should always decrease your objective. A simple check when writing these optimization procedures is to print your objectives and verify that this is the case (or plot them with matplotlib).\n",
    "4. You can also use scipy.optimize.check_grad to numerically verify the correctness of your gradients.\n",
    "5. For the unlikely boundary case where your hypothesis outputs 0, we will treat that as a positive prediction. \n",
    "6. Be careful of numpy.matrix objects which are constrained to always have dimension 2 (scipy operations will sometimes return this instead of an ndarray). \n",
    "7. The exact objective function to implement is: $$\n",
    "\\mathcal L(y, X, \\theta, \\lambda) = \\text{sum}\\left\\{\\text{max}\\{1 - y\\cdot \\theta^T X, 0 \\}\\right\\} + \\frac\\lambda2(\\theta\\cdot\\theta)\n",
    "$$ where $X$ is the input, $y$ is the true label, $\\theta$ is the model weight, and $\\lambda$ is the regularization weight. The inner `max` operation is performed over each element, and the outer `sum` operation returns the sum of the elements of the vector.\n",
    "8. The gradient is:$$\n",
    "    v = \\mathbb1\\left\\{y* (X \\theta)) <= 1\\right\\}\n",
    "\\\\    \n",
    "\\\\    \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\mathcal L} = \\text{sum}_\\text{col}\\{-y* v*X\\} + \\lambda\\theta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the $\\text{sum}_\\text{col}$ operation calculates the sum over each column, producing a vector the same shape as $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are a few different types of multiplication involved in this: \n",
    "    - matrix-vector,\n",
    "    - vector-vector dot product,\n",
    "    - scalar-vector product,\n",
    "    - vector-vector _element-wise_ product,\n",
    "    - a vector-matrix _row-wise_ product (where each element of a vector multiplies the corresponding row of a matrix) \n",
    "2. Keep track of the shape of each intermediate product! It will help you as you implement this.\n",
    "3. Read the math above and notice how we have restructured the multiplication.\n",
    "4. In the gradient calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $X$ has as many rows as the length of $y$, and as many columns as the length of $\\theta$\n",
    "    - $v$ is a vector containing only ones and zeros, the same size as $y$; \n",
    "    - $-y*v$ is a vector the same length as $y$\n",
    "    - $(-y*v)*X$ is the same size as $X$.\n",
    "5. If these equations don't make sense, you should consult the slides; the same equations are written sample-by-sample there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful tricks for debugging: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use very simple inputs (i.e. small vectors of ones) and compare the output of each function with a hand calculation. \n",
    "2. One way to guarantee your gradient is correct is to verify it numerically using a derivative approximation. You can read more about numerical differentiation methods here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference) but for your purposes, you can use scipy.optimize.check_grad to do the numerical checking for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the specifications, fill out the `SVM` class below."

    "How can we evaluate our choice of parameters? One way is to perform k-fold cross validation, which operates as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We split the data into k+1 randomly selected but uniformly sized pieces, and set aside one block for testing.\n",
    "2. For each of the remaining k parts, we train the model on k-1 parts and validate our model on the heldout part. \n",
    "3. This gives k results, and the average of these runs gives the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that by holding out part of the dataset as validation data, we can train and measure our generalization ability. Note the key fact here: the training does not see the validation data at all, which is why it measures generalization! Randomizing the groups removes bias from ordering (i.e. if these results occurred in chronological order, we don't want to train on only Monday's results to predict on Wednesday's results), and averaging over the groups reduces the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will use classification error rate as our result metric (so the fraction of times in which our model returns the wrong answer). Calculating this value via k-fold cross validation gives us a measure of how well our model generalizes to new data (lower error rate is better). \n",

    "    * set aside the k+1th group as the testing block, and use the remaining k blocks for cross validation\n",
    "    * use the permutation as indices to select the rows that correspond to that block\n",
    "    * Example: `k=2`, `P=[1,3,2,4,5,6]` sets aside `[5,6]` as the test set, and break the remaining permutation into `[[1,3],[2,4]]` so the blocks of data for validation are `X[[1,3],:]` and `X[[2,4],:]`\n",
    "    * the order of the indices in the blocks should match the order in the original permutation\n",
    "2. Implement the `cross_validation` function. For each group k, train the model on all other datapoints, and compute the error rate on the held-out group. Return the average error rate over all k folds. \n",

Given two lists of parameters, we compute the classification error using k-fold cross validation for each pair of parameters, and output the parameters that produces the best validation result. Our solution takes ~ 1 minute and 45 seconds to run a grid search on learning rates [0.1, 1, 10] and regularization [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10] with 100 iterations and k=4.\n",
